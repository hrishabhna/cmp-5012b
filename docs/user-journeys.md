## Journey 2: John Healthilo's Journey

![User Journey 2](../design/user_journey_2.png)

Short explanation of the journey:

- Entry point: John wants to lose weight and organise time for him to do so through exercise. He sees an advertisement for the health tracker and decides to buy it
- Key steps: Every Saturday John goes for a run for an hour. After the run the health tracker shows him the amount of calcories he has burnt as well as an estimate of how long it will take for him to reach the weight goal he set. He also enters into the health tracker what food he's eating during the day. John doesn't completely understand all the data the health tracker shows him of his fitness journey but the data shows his its going in a positive trajectory so he assumes he's doing everything correctly. Some of the food John gets recommended is either too expensive or he doesn't recognise it so he only gets the food recommended to him that he knows and has access to.
- Expected outcome: Within a month John should be able to weigh himself and see a loss in his weight, indicating to him that the health tracker is doing its job correctly. This should then lead him to recommend the health tracker to his co-workers and then get them to buy and use the health tracker. With more people using the health tracker, more data should become available allowing for more in depth analyses and better suggestions from the health tracker.
