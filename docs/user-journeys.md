## Journey 1: Janice Smith's Journey

![User Journey 1](../design/user_journey_1.png)

Short explanation of the journey:

- Entry point: Janice hears about the health tracker from a co-worker. The co-worker suggests that it could help her better manage the nutients of the food she prepares for events. Janice has wanted to switch to meal prepped food as well as increase protein and fruit intake so she decides to take this opportunity to buy the health tracker and use it for the food she prepares for events.
- Key steps: Janice enters the food she prepares into the health tracker to see what nutrients the meal is lacking so that she can prepare for the rest of the meal to account for that lack of nutrients. She also tries to see how to increase protein and fruit intake though the the health tracker only shows her what food provide the best protein and fruit intake rather than what food would increase protein and fruit intake within her meal specifically.
- Expected outcome: Through the use of the health tracker, Janice should see improvements in the quality of the meals she prepares for her events indicated by better reviews of her food by clients.

## Journey 2: John Healthilo's Journey

![User Journey 2](../design/user_journey_2.png)

Short explanation of the journey:

- Entry point: John wants to lose weight and organise time for him to do so through exercise. He sees an advertisement for the health tracker and decides to buy it
- Key steps: Every Saturday John goes for a run for an hour. After the run the health tracker shows him the amount of calcories he has burnt as well as an estimate of how long it will take for him to reach the weight goal he set. He also enters into the health tracker what food he's eating during the day. John doesn't completely understand all the data the health tracker shows him of his fitness journey but the data shows his its going in a positive trajectory so he assumes he's doing everything correctly. Some of the food John gets recommended is either too expensive or he doesn't recognise it so he only gets the food recommended to him that he knows and has access to.
- Expected outcome: Within a month John should be able to weigh himself and see a loss in his weight, indicating to him that the health tracker is doing its job correctly. This should then lead him to recommend the health tracker to his co-workers and then get them to buy and use the health tracker. With more people using the health tracker, more data should become available allowing for more in depth analyses and better suggestions from the health tracker.
